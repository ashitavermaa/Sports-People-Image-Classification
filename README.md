Developed an end-to-end image classification solution to identify my favorite sports personalities. Leveraged OpenCV for precise facial and eye detection, enhancing data quality. Engineered features using wavelet transforms for improved accuracy. Employed SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models, opti-
mizing them with GridSearchCV.
